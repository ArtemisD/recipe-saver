Recipe search engine where users can seach for recipes and save the recipes they want to view later. 
Built using ReactJS, Babel, jQuery, and Food2Fork's recipe data API on the front-end and MongoDB, Express, and Node.js on the back-end.

This is a solo project I completed as a student at hackreactor.
